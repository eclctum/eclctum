# About me

**eclctum/eclctum** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

-  I’m currently learning quantum mechanics
-  I like math and physics, although I am not good at it
-  I want to build a personal website, showing and storing documents, writings, pictures, come here to have a try.
